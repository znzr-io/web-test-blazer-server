## Architectural Rationale

---

### Original Design Goals

When I started this project, I had several objectives:

* Learn Blazor deeply through practical implementation
* Find an architecture that would allow me to easely expand with already made Unity3d classes
* Build genuinely reusable primitives rather than one-off components
* Enable dynamic content rendering without hardcoded layouts
* Create both a public site and an admin editor sharing a single framework
* Establish modular structure ready for future expansion
* Have AIRTABLE working as a plugin inside a bigger system

### Achieved Results

The current implementation delivers on these goals:

* Editor components are fully reusable across different contexts
* Site and Editor share the same foundation code
* Airtable schema directly drives UI generation
* JSON caching layer provides offline capability and performance
* Clear separation between data layer, UI layer, and rendering logic
* Unity3d code can be used as well, with some minor tweaking as Blazor doesnt use Monobehaviours

This architecture proved the viability of schema-driven UI generation and became the foundation for a larger vision.

## Technical Lessons and Evolution

### Implementation Insights

Several technical patterns emerged as particularly effective:

* The static Air class serves its purpose but would benefit from proper dependency injection in a production refactor
* Editor and UI components can be dynamically generated from metadata alone
* Schema-driven rendering provides both power and maintainability
* The codebase structure naturally supports modularization into plugin DLLs

### Architectural Insights

The project validated several architectural principles:

* A clear component numbering pattern (00_Core through 08_Panels) scales well as complexity grows
* Metadata-driven systems dramatically reduce code duplication
* This type of system architecture benefits significantly from AI integration
* The line between "configuration" and "code" can be productively blurred

## Modularity

The architecture implements orthogonal concerns across a layered foundation, where capabilities like governance, AI augmentation, and data generation can be independently applied to any layer without coupling

**ARCHITECTURE** (vertical micro -> macro)

| Folder / Module   | Description                                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `01_Displays`     | Read/output: text, images, Unity3D, etc.                           |
| `02_Fields`       | Read & write inputs (form fields, editors, etc.)                   |
| `03_Pointers`     | Interaction helpers: buttons, dropdowns, selectors, etc.           |
